# Notes-App
A simple python notes app

   To use the app make sure to have python downloaded, create a folder to hold the repository, go to vscode and copy the repository into that folder, then run the "Application.py" file. 
     When inputing on most parts of the application use the enter key to finalize the response or follow the directions for submitting a response.

    This is my first ever python project and I did this to learn the basics of python so that I could use it for my other projects.
feel free to send me feedback on your experience!
